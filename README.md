# godot-ansi-escape-to-bbcode

Terminal consoles use ANSI escape sequences (e.g. ESC + [1;32m) to control bold, italic and color (among others). 
This repo contains a script which allows populating a RichTextLabel converting bold, italic and 8 colors from ANSI terminal escape sequences to BBCode.


(This repo is not a project, just a script I had around in my HDD so making the repo to share it with MIT license.)
